      <h2 id="abstract">1. Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        The “Cryma” application (Cryptocurrency “Smart” Manager) is an application that tracks, displays and provides
        temporal details (starting with the present time) about the cryptocurrency prices.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="introduction">2. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Cryma is an application dedicated to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The application offers users the chance to
      track a multitude of cryptocurrencies, to analyze the progress of each currency throughout the prism of a time
      chart. The user can choose from three different time intervals, these having 24 hours, 7 days or a year, past from
      the current moment. At the same time, the user can select several currencies, which he wants to view constantly,
      and save them for later, as a list of favorites.
    </p>
    <h2 id="structure">3. Structure</h2>

    <h4>In this chapter, we will present the structure of the project, which consists of the following:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Technologies used in creating the application;</li>
      <li>API structure;</li>
      <li>Application paradigms;</li>
      <li>Structure of the application.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="technologies">3.1 Technologies</h3>

    <h4>For the development of the app, we will use:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        React Javascript library to build the user interface. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of
        individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile
        applications.
        Compared to other frontend technologies such as Angular or Vue.js that are considered frameworks, React is a
        library. React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually
        requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are
        respective examples of such libraries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Material-ui React UI framework for a faster and easier development. Material-UI is one of the top user
        interface frameworks for React out there. It gives developers a multitude of options, from a large array of text
        components, to premade grids, flexboxes, buttons, different types of inputs, icons, and so on. It also gives
        developers the chance to create their own CSS themes and use them across their apps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chart.js library, in order to create the charts displayed in the app. Chart.js is a free open-source
        JavaScript library for data visualization, which supports 8 chart types: bar, line, area, pie (doughnut),
        bubble, radar, polar, and scatter. It is maintained by the community and is the second most popular JS charting
        library on
        GitHub.
      </li>
      <li>
        Axios, a popular HTTP client that helps us create requests. Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that sports
        an
        easy-to-use API and can be used in the browser.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div>
      <h3 id="api">3.2 API</h3>
      <p>
        API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two
        applications to talk to each other. To be more specific it’s an information gateway that allows the backends of
        software and services to communicate with one another.
        How does this work? An API is the messenger that delivers your request to the provider that you're requesting it
        from and then delivers the response back to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        APIs work using ‘requests’ and ‘responses’. When an API requests information from a web application or web
        server,
        it will receive a response. The place that APIs send requests and where the resource lives, is called an
        endpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API that will be used for the application is <a href="https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3">CoinGecko</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        CoinGecko provides a fundamental analysis of the crypto market. In addition to tracking price, volume and market
        capitalization, CoinGecko tracks community growth, open-source code development, major events and on-chain
        metrics. The objective of this API is to elevate crypto participants’ understanding of fundamental factors that
        drive the market. It currently tracks nearly 5968 tokens from more than 410 cryptocurrency exchanges.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h4>In the development of the application we will use these 2 endpoints:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>GET</strong> <i>/coins/${id}/market_chart/id?vs_currency=usd&days=1&interval=daily</i>
        <strong>-></strong>
        Get historical market data including price, market cap, and 24h volume (granularity auto). It can take the
        following parameters: id (passes the coin id), vs_currency (The target currency of market data), days (Data up
        to number of days ago), interval (Optional) (Data interval).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>GET</strong> <i>/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&ids=bitcoin</i> <strong>-></strong> Lists all supported
        coins price, market cap, volume, and market related data. It can take many more parameters, like category,
        order, page or price_change_percentage, but for this application only 2 will be used: vs_currency (The target
        currency of market data) and ids (The ids of the coin, comma separated cryptocurrency symbols).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>This API offers many more endpoints, such as:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>GET</strong> /coins/{id}/history - Get historical data (name, price, market, stats) at a given date for
        a coin.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>GET</strong> /coins/{id}/market_chart/range - Get historical market data include price, market cap, and
        24h volume within a range of timestamp.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>GET</strong> /coins/{id}/status_updates - Get status updates for a given coin.
      </li>
      There are many others endpoints. For a more detailed description of the API can be found at this
      <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/api">link</a>. But for the first version of the application the chosen two
      endpoints are enough.
    </ul>
    <div>
      <h3 id="paradigms">3.3 Paradigms</h3>
      <p>
        Since the creation of React, the library has gone through significant changes. Nowadays there are three
        different ways of writing React, either using class components, functional components or a combination of both,
        each having their ups and downs. But lately, more and more React developers have switched to the functional
        components type of development, using React Hooks, since it makes the development process easier than the class
        components way. More than that, using functional components de-bloats the app as a whole, which makes it way
        faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, for the development of the app, we will use React Hooks, which uses the functional components approach.
        Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that were encountered since the inception
        of the React library. Before hooks, it was hard to reuse stateful logic between components, but now, you can
        extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused in other components. So, in
        shorter words, creating our custom hooks helps us abstract logic and reuse it in other components.
      </p>

      <h3 id="app-structure">3.4 App Structure</h3>
      <h4>Front-end</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The frontend application will be created using the create-react-app toolchain, that will set up the
          development environment, so that we can use the latest JavaScript features, and also optimize the app for
          production.
        </li>
        <li>
          The app will be developed as SPA (Single page application), having one big component, which usually is called
          App. From our App component, the rest of the application will stem, basically creating a tree of smaller
          components, as you can see in the image below.
        </li>
        <li>
          As mentioned, we will be using Material-ui framework in order to create our components. To give our components
          a proper design we will make use of the styled components approach provided by this framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          To access the CoinGecko API, we will create an API controller. This will define a few methods that return
          diverse information, ex: get the price fluctuation of a certain coin over a period of time (24 hours, 7 days
          or 1 year).
        </li>
        <li>
          In order to abstract the logic of fetching all the coin related data we will create a hook and it will be used
          wherever it will be needed.
        </li>
        <p>As of now, we don’t see any other structural or architectural need for the frontend of the application.</p>
      </ul>
      <h4>Back-end</h4>
      <h4>As of now we see two approaches for the back-end:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Go with a ‘serverless’ approach, meaning we won’t create a dedicated server for the application and just use
          the services already created in the front-end.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a dedicated node.js server, using the express framework. This server will act as a proxy to the
          CoinGecko API and serve the data to the frontend app.
        </li>
      </ul>
