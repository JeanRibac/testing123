      <p>

    <h2 id="introduction">2. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Cryma is an application dedicated to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The application offers users the chance to
      track a multitude of cryptocurrencies, to analyze the progress of each currency throughout the prism of a time
      chart. The user can choose from three different time intervals, these having 24 hours, 7 days or a year, past from
      the current moment. At the same time, the user can select several currencies, which he wants to view constantly,
      and save them for later, as a list of favorites.

    <h4>In this chapter, we will present the structure of the project, which consists of the following:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Technologies used in creating the application;</li>
      <li>API structure;</li>
      <li>Application paradigms;</li>
      <li>Structure of the application.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="technologies">3.1 Technologies</h3>

    <h4>For the development of the app, we will use:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        React Javascript library to build the user interface. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of
        individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile
        applications.
        Compared to other frontend technologies such as Angular or Vue.js that are considered frameworks, React is a
        library. React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually
        requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are
        respective examples of such libraries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Material-ui React UI framework for a faster and easier development. Material-UI is one of the top user
        interface frameworks for React out there. It gives developers a multitude of options, from a large array of text
        components, to premade grids, flexboxes, buttons, different types of inputs, icons, and so on. It also gives
        developers the chance to create their own CSS themes and use them across their apps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chart.js library, in order to create the charts displayed in the app. Chart.js is a free open-source
        JavaScript library for data visualization, which supports 8 chart types: bar, line, area, pie (doughnut),
        bubble, radar, polar, and scatter. It is maintained by the community and is the second most popular JS charting
        library on
        GitHub.
      </li>
      <li>
        Axios, a popular HTTP client that helps us create requests. Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that sports
        an
        easy-to-use API and can be used in the browser.
      </li>
    </ol>
